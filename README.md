# Data Analysis
**Data-analysis** - is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. 

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - a critical process in data analysis, and it serves as the initial step before diving into more indepth analysis or modeling.

# Linear Regression
**Linear Regression** - A statistical method used in the field of data analysis and predictive modeling. It's particularly useful in understanding and modeling relationships between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features or predictors).

# Logistic Regression
**Logistic Regression** is a statistical technique used for predicting the outcome of a categorical dependent variable based on one or more predictor variables. It models the probability of a binary event occurring, such as success/failure, yes/no, or pass/fail scenarios.
